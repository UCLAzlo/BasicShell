# BasicShell

This is a basic shell intended to run on top of a Unix OS. This project was originally created for an Operating Systems Class.

This shell has built-in commands for cd, exit, and status. Other commands are executed by forking off child processes. This basic shell can also: allow commands in foreground and background, terminate zombie processes, alter default signal behaviors to better mimic a bash shell.

To run:
- Clone the repository
- Use the provided makefile with the "make" command
- Start the shell with the "basicShell" command
